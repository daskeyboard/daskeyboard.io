incomplete, and poorly documented.  However it is improving
quickly. Only use it if you are comfortable being a beta software and
contributing useful feedback.

## Sending Signals to your 5Q keyboard + developer API

A bit of lingo first: a *signal* is a message that contains color
information (and more) to be displayed on a 5Q keyboard. All 3rd party
platforms communicate with the Q clients by sending signals very much
like your friends send text messages to your phone. Instead of being a
text message, a signal contains also key color information.

Even without a real Q device, you can play with Signals. Signals will
be displayed on the Q desktop "dashboard mode" and the Q Android app.

There are several possibilities to send signals to the 5Q keyboard:

- [Zapier](https://zapier.com): use Zapier clould platform to create
 zaps.  Select the Action called "Das Keyboard
 Q". Zapier will create signals based on triggers such as emails,
 Facebook events, even new Youtube videos and much more. The app is
 currently working with invitations only, here is the link to access
 it:
 <https://zapier.com/developer/invite/52454/1adf69b9a21dcfa16a1953d99baf253e/>.
 - You can also create your own script with the [Q
 API]({{site.baseurl}}/q-api-quick-start/).

## Q Developer API

The developer Q API is an easy to use JSON REST API to send signals to
the Q device.
