## Overview

You can communicate with your device throught 2 different APIs.
A cloud api and a local api

### Cloud API

The script you write on any machine will communicate with the cloud,
the cloud will communicate with the Q desktop installed on the computer and then the Q desktop will
communicate to the Q enabled device plugged in on this computer.
This script can be hosted on any online server and will still communicate with the Q enabled.

- Speed (~20 Seconds)
- Internet Accessibility
- OAuth credential requirement
- Messages can be viewed in Q Signal Centre https://qapp.daskeyboard.com/signals
- Mobile app can see signals

### Local API

The script needs to be running on the machine where the Q enabled device is plugged in.
The script will communicate directly to the Q desktop that opens a web server on the port 27301.
The Q desktop will then communicate with the Q enabled device.

- Speed: quasi-instantaneous
- Limited Accessibility - Commands can only be sent locally http://localhost:27301
- No credential requirement
- Not reliant on Q Cloud, useful if Q Cloud is down or performing maintenance
- Can be used offline
- Privacy – Signals are not stored on the cloud database
- Messages will not appear in Q Signal Centre - https://qapp.daskeyboard.com/signals
- Mobile apps will not see these signals
