                <li>Download the firmware file. If the 5Q firmware is up to date, the installer will not perform the upgrade. The current 5Q firmware version is displayed on the home page of the Q Desktop software. It is also displayed when running the firmware upgrade application.</li>
                <li><span style="color:red;">IMPORTANT:</span> Quit the Das Keyboard Q Service. Look for Services in Windows menu, find the Das Keyboard Q Service, right click on it and select "stop".</li>
                <li>Double click the firmware file to “Run” it. Windows 10 Defender may display a message regarding an “unrecognized app” that has been prevented from starting. You will need to run it in order to upgrade the firmware on the 5Q. To enable the firmware upgrade to proceed, please click on <code>More Info</code> and follow the prompts to run the upgrader and update the firmware.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to start the Service again when the firmware upgrade is finished.</li>

            At this point, the firmware upgrade has to be performed on a Windows computer even for Mac and Linux. Please note that the firmware upgrade only fixes some issues related to the hardware. It will not make the keyboard communicate with the Q Desktop software since the communication is handle by a service component that is not available yet for Mac and Linux.
