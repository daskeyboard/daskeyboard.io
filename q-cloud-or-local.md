## Overview

A developer can communicate with a Q device via a cloud or a local (desktop) API. Both API are compatible.

### Cloud API

This is the case where a script connect to a public Q API in the cloud. Das Keyboard Q cloud
 will communicate with the Q desktop installed on the computer and will
communicate with connected Q enabled devices.

- propagation: about 5 minutes
- Accessibility

### Local API

A script can communicate directly to the Q desktop API on port 27301.
The Q desktop will then communicate with the Q enabled device.

- Signal propagation: < 1s
- Commands can only be sent locally to http://localhost:27301
- No credential requirement
- Not reliant on Q Cloud, useful if Q Cloud is down or performing maintenance
- Can be used offline
- Privacy â€“ Signals are not stored on the Q cloud database
